const aboutMe = "Iâ€™m an experienced software developer who has worked in early stage startups and large established companies. \
I started my career working for a large financial institution in the midwest automating test cases. \
This position entailed training and working closely with other team members to establish their programming and automation skills. \
I held one-on-one sessions as well as led group training sessions. Through automation the team and I saved hundreds of man hours a year in automation testing."

const second = " From there I moved on to a proper software developer role. I have substantial experience working in Ruby on Rails and a variety of javascript frameworks. \
My professional experience includes building RESTful APIs, creating complex user work flows in single page applications, enhancing ETL pipelines, and data modeling. \
Iâ€™ve worked across the stack and feel comfortable on each side."


const third = " Continuous learning is something I feel passionate about. \
When Iâ€™m not helping build products Iâ€™m pursuing a masters degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \
The curriculum has broadened my technical horizons writing programs in Java, C, C++, and python. Although Ruby is the language Iâ€™m most comfortable with Iâ€™m happy to program in any language."

const fourth = " Besides staring at a computer screen I also enjoy training for and participating in triathlons. \
I have 4 olympic distance races under my belt and look forward to completing more. \
On nice Sunday mornings you can find me at Ohio street beach swimming in Lake Michigan."
